## About this repository

This repository demonstrates how to build an API with the Joomla Framework, using a "standard" model, view, controller pattern with full Dependency Injection using the Joomla DI Container

### Open API
The [Open API Initiative (OAI)](https://openapis.org/) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how REST APIs are described 

This repository uses the Open API initiative to generate documentation of the endpoints and also for use as a routing file.

### Presentations
This repository was demonstrated as part of J And Beyond 2016 in Barcelona
